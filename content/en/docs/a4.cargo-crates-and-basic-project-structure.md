## Cargo

Cargo is Rust’s built-in package manager and the build system. It can be used to,

- Create a new project: `cargo new`
- Create a new project in an existing directory: `cargo init`
- Build the project: `cargo build`
- Run the project: `cargo run`
- Update project dependencies: `cargo update`
- Run tests: `cargo test`
- Run benchmarks: `cargo bench`
- Generate the project documentation via [rustdoc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rustdoc/): `cargo doc`
- Analyze the project to see it has any errors, without building it: `cargo check`

In addition, there are `cargo` commands to publish the project as a crate/ package to **Rust's official crate registry, [crates.io](https://crates.io/)**.

> 💡 We need to get an API token from [crates.io](https://crates.io/) to publish a crate to it. The API token can be found in the [Account Settings page](https://crates.io/me), after login to that site. We will discuss more about this under [code organization with crates](/docs/crates#c-using-cratesio).

- Login to [crates.io](https://crates.io/) with the API token: `cargo login`
- Make the local crate uploadable to [crates.io](https://crates.io/): `cargo package`
- Upload the crate to [crates.io](https://crates.io/): `cargo publish`
- Install a Rust binary: `cargo install`
- Uninstall a Rust binary: `cargo uninstall`

## Crate

A crate is a package, which can be shared via [crates.io](https://crates.io/). A crate can produce an executable or a library. In other words, it can be a **binary** crate or a **library** crate.

01. `cargo new crate_name --bin` or `cargo new crate_name`: Produces an executable
02. `cargo new crate_name --lib`: Produces a library

The first one generates,

```
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── main.rs
```

and the second one generates,

```
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── lib.rs
```

- **Cargo.toml**\(capital c\) is the configuration file which contains all of the metadata that Cargo needs to compile your project.
- **src** folder is the place to store the source code.
- Each crate has an implicit crate root/ entry point. **main.rs** is the crate root for a binary crate and **lib.rs** is the crate root for a library crate.

> 💡 When we build a binary crate via `cargo build` or `cargo run`, the executable file will be stored in the **target/debug/** folder. But when building it via **`cargo build --release`** for a release it will be stored in the **target/release/** folder. The release builds are applying more optimizations while compiling the code, to make the code run faster. But it takes more compile time.

## Project Structure

This is how [Cargo documentation describes](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/project-layout.html) about the recommended project layout,

```
.
├── Cargo.toml
├── Cargo.lock
├── src
│   ├── main.rs
│   ├── lib.rs
│   └── bin
│       └── another_executable.rs
├── tests
│   └── some_integration_tests.rs
├── benches
│   └── simple_bench.rs
└── examples
    └── simple_example.rs
```

- The source code goes in the `src` directory.
    - The default executable file is `src/main.rs`.
    - The default library file is `src/lib.rs`.
    - Other executables can be placed in `src/bin/*.rs`.
- Integration tests go in the `tests` directory \(unit tests go in each file they're testing\).
- Benchmarks go in the `benches` directory.
- Examples go in the `examples` directory.

## Rust Editions

After the initial release in 2015, according to the feedback got from user communities, the Rust team was focusing to increase the **productivity** of the language and the ecosystem. After 3 years of hard work in 2018, a new Rust edition was released with new features, simplified syntax and better tooling. We call it **Rust 2018** edition.

To keep the promise of supporting backward compatibility, the new `edition = "2018"` configuration was added to the `Cargo.toml` file. For new projects, the `cargo new` command adds this configuration by default. So, you don't need to care. But on legacy crates, if you can not see any `edition` configuration, Cargo will consider it as a Rust 2015 edition crate.

## 👨‍🏫 Before going to the next...

- The **`.cargo/bin` directory of your home directory** is the default location of Rust binaries. Not only the official binaries like `rustup`, `rustc`, `cargo`, `rustfmt`, `rustdoc`, `rls` and also the binaries you can install via `cargo install` command, will be stored in this directory.

- Even though the initial convention for naming crates and file names is using the [`snake_case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case), some crate developers are using `kebab-case` on both crates and file names. To make your code more consistent, use the initial convention `snake_case`; especially on file names.

- Create an executable crate via `cargo new` command and run it via `cargo run`.

- Create a library crate via `cargo new` command and run `cargo test`.
